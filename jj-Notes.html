2. 3 variables are var. ES6 variables are let and const.
 'const' can only be used once. The value (const) can only be updated with the .push() function.
  'Let' is used for block scooping in for() loops. 
  'var' key word is 2015 varible declaration but its still valid use.

3. Object literals. {}, Array [], console.log(); 

4. Javascript goes in script tags
<script>
//code goes here
</script>
