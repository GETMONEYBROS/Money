1. I learned sourcetree. Works with gitHub.

2. 3 variables are var. ES6 variables are let and const.
 'const' can only be used once. The value (const) can only be updated with the .push() function.
  'Let' is used for block scooping in for() loops. 
  'var' key word is 2015 varible declaration but its still valid use.

3. Object literals. {}, Array [], console.log(); 

4. Javascript goes in script tags
<script>
//code goes here
</script>

5. <script src=""></script>

6.check spelling (case sensitive) , bugs, ";,(),{},[]" etc.

7. Dot notation. (blah.blah)

8. undefined = uncalled

9. https://babeljs.io/repl (this is ES6 editor)

10. the ways print out your data is: console.log(), alert(), return, document.write(), .innter.HTML,  .text(), .html(), .append()
